                  We completed redesigned their existing website and built their
                  new website using Next.js (a modern JavaScript framework)
                  which pre-renders pages for the very fast loading speeds. Page
                  speed is a key factor in Google rankings with at 20% increase
                  in speed translating to a 10% improvement in Google Rankings,
                  and improves the user experience. In 2021, Google announced
                  the page experience algorithm update, demonstrating that page
                  speed and user experience are intertwined. Core Web Vitals
                  clearly state that speed is an essential ranking factor. The
                  update also gave site owners metrics and standards to work
                  with.
